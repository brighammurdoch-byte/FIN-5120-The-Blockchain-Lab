# FIN 5120: Blockchain Lab!!!

Welcome to the blockchain lab for FIN 5120! This repository contains Python scripts for the class so students can get a hands on learning experiences 
with bockchain technology. Frequently use AI to help you understand parts you don't know! Feel free to experiment with the code and try new things. 
Get your hands dirty!!!

## Project Overview

*   **`wallet_generator.py`**: Generates a new Ethereum Public Address and Private Key. It saves these securely to a `.env` file.
*   **`testnet_wallet.py`**: Connects to the blockchain, checks if your keys are loaded, and displays your current balance of SepoliaETH.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Installation

1.  **Download the code**: Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2.  **Open Terminal**: Navigate to the project folder in your command prompt or terminal.
3.  **Install Libraries**: Run the following command to install `web3` and `python-dotenv`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Create your Wallet
Run the generator script once:
```bash
python wallet_generator.py
```
*   **Output**: You will see your new Public Address.
*   **Security**: Your Private Key is saved to a hidden `.env` file. Do not share this file.

### 2. Check Connection & Balance
Run the wallet script:
```bash
python testnet_wallet.py
```
*   If successful, it will print "Connected to Sepolia Testnet".
*   If you have 0 ETH, it will provide a link to a Faucet to get free test funds.

## Troubleshooting
*   **"No keys found"**: Make sure you ran `wallet_generator.py` first.
*   **Connection Failed**: Ensure you have an internet connection. Public nodes can sometimes be busy; try again in a minute.
